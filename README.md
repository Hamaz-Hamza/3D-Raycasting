# 3D-Raycasting: Simulating 3D entirly from scratch using 2D raycasting.

A Processing sketch made using the processing IDE.

This is a continuation of 2D raycasting, in which several light rays are sent out from the source light and the data of the distance covered by each light ray is used to draw a column on the screen with height inversly proportional to the distance covered by the light ray. This results in a 3D game-like simulation. Obviously alot more mathemtaics and logic is involved in producing the actual 3D result you see in the demo.

This may seem really primitive and useless, but keep in mind that the 3D results were produced by drawing only 2D rectangles on the screen, and a ton of mathematics and logic is involved in order to display the 3D result based on only the data received from the 2D simulation.

To run the sketch, you would need the processing IDE.
